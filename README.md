# cf-geo-steering-config

An app to help with Cloudflare's load balancer config (using geo steering) by
generating a map that contains prioritization for cities you have pools in.

If you're wondering why it takes long to load: note the TODO in util/index.ts.
I currently don't have time to fix this but am happy about contributions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
